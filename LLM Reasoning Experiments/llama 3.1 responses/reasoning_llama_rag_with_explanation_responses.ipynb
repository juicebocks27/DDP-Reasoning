Normally we?d just check each rule against\\nthe choices and eliminate the choices that violate a rule. However, there?s something we need to\\nnotice about this acceptability question. Thanks to the circular design of the table, the first person of\\neach list (in chair 1) is next to the last (in chair 6). For example, we need to realize that, in choice\\n(A), Klosnik sits next to Londi. With that in mind, we can treat this just like any other acceptability\\nquestion; just grab each rule and cross off any choice that violates that rule. Rule 1 is violated by\\nanswer choice (E) which doesn?t have Poirier next to Neri. Rule 2 requires that Londi be next to\\nManley, Neri, or both. Answer choice (A) has Londi next to Osata and Klosnik (Londi in seat 6 and\\nKlosnik in seat 1) and so can be eliminated. Rule 3 forbids Klosnik to be next to Manley which\\nanswer choice (D) tries (Manley in seat 6 wraps around and is next to Klosnik in seat 1). Finally, the\\nconditional Rule 4 is violated by answer choice (C) which has Osata next to both Poirier and Manley.\\nChoice \"Klosnik, Londi, Manley, Poirier, Neri, Osata\" remains and is the credited response.'),\n",

Manley is\\non one side of Londi, and the question asks for a complete list of all of the reps who could be on the\\nother side. In the previous question, Q. 4, Londi was next to Manley on one side and could be next\\nto either Klosnik or Osata on the other.

Londi is on one side of Neri, so Rule 1 forces Poirier\\nto sit on the other side of Neri. Where to now? We?re left with Klosnik, Manley, and Osata to fill in\\nthe remaining three adjacent slots. We know from Rule 3 that Klosnik and Manley can?t sit next to\\neach other, so they will have to be separated by Osata.

The dates are all identical except for the last digit, so we?ll only concern ourselves\\nwith that digit.\\nThe Rules:\\n1) In each office, the computer was bought either earlier than or the same year as the printer in that\\noffice. In other words, if the computer in 1 was bought in 1988, then the printer in 1 must have been\\nbought in 1988 or 89. Build this directly into the sketch.

Both of these facts are hints that there?s some\\nmajor deducing to be done here. So let?s get started.\\nBegin with the concrete info in Rule 5. The computer in office 1 was bought in 88. Rule 1 says that\\neach office?s computer was bought earlier than or the same year as that office?s printer. So the\\nprinter in office 1 must have been bought in 88 or 89. Add this to the sketch.\\nRule 2 says that the printer in office 1 was bought the same year as the computer in office 2. Since\\nwe just saw that the printer in office 1 was bought in 88 or 89, so was the computer in office 2. Add\\nthis to the sketch.\\nFrom there Rule 1 comes back into play. Since the computer in office 2 was bought in 88 or 89, the\\nprinter in office 2 must also have been bought in 88 or 89. Add this to the sketch.\\nBack to Rule 5.

Check our master sketch. There\\nare only three machines that could have been bought in 87. The computer in 3, the computer in 4,\\nand the printer in 4 all were bought in 87 or 88. The stem asks for the fewest number of machines\\nbought in 87, so could all three of these have been bought in 88? Sure.

Rule 1 says that the computer in each office must have been bought the same year as\\nor before the printer in that office, so the computer in 4 could have been bought in 88 as well. All of\\nthe other machines couldn?t have been purchased in 87 (see Key Deductions), so it turns out that\\nwe need not have any 87 machines.

If the computer in 4 was bought in 88, the printer in 4 must\\nalso have been bought in 88 (we ruled out 89 as a possibility for the printer in 4 under Key\\nDeductions).

It?s\\nnot (although we can eliminate (E) which has the printer in 4 bought in 89), so keep looking.\\nRule 3 says that the printer in 4 and the computer in 3 were bought the same year, so the computer\\nin 3 must have been bought in 88. Is that a choice? No, but we can cross off (D) which has it bought\\nin 87.\\nRule 4 says that the computer in 2 can?t have been purchased the same year as the computer in 3,\\nso here the computer in 2 must have been bought in 89 (again check Key Deductions to see how 87\\nwas eliminated for the computer in 2).

No, but\\nwe now know that (C) must be false, so cross it off.\\nMoving along, Rule 2 says that the computer in 2 and the printer in 1 were bought the same year, so\\nthe printer in 1 was bought in 89, and finally that?s the answer, choice (B).\\nQuestion 17:\\nContext: A small software firm has four offices, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Rule 4 (computer in 3 and computer in 2 bought in different years) means that the\\ncomputer in 2 was bought in 89. From there, Rule 2 (computer in 2 and printer in 1 bought in the\\nsame year) insists that the printer in 1 was bought in 89.

Now we?re to\\nconsider what happens when the opposite of Rule 4 is true. The computer in 2 and the computer in\\n3 now are bought in the same year. Take a moment and create a new master sketch including this\\nnew information. Look at the original sketch and note what information still holds. The deduction that\\nthe printer in 1 was bought in 88 or 89 still holds, as does Rule 2 which means that the computer in\\n2 was also bought in 88 or 89. The stem says that the computers in 2 and 3 were bought in the\\nsame year, so the computer in 3 must also have been bought in 88 or 89. But wait. The printer in 3\\nwas bought in 88, so Rule 1 means that the computer in 3 can only have been bought in 88. This\\nalso means that the computer in 2 was also bought in 88 (thanks to the new information in the\\nstem). From there, Rule 2 means that the printer in 1 was bought in 88 as well. Since the computer\\nin 3 was bought in 88, Rule 3 forces the printer in 4 to have been bought in 88. The only machines\\nthat possibly weren?t bought in 88 are the printer in 2 (88 or 89) and the computer in 4 (87 or 88).\\nThe printer in 2 is the only machine that could have been bought in 89, choice (C).\\nQuestion 19:\\nContext: The eight employees of a company are G, H, I, J, K,M, N, and O.

Put the years\\nalong the side and list the employees. Notice that, as in Set 2, we?ve shortened the years to just 1\\nthrough 8. (You could also have worked horizontally by listing the years left to right like a timeline.\\nWhichever way you choose, just make sure that your sketch is neat and not misleading.)\\nThe Rules:\\nA good way to start is to locate a employee or employees who might come at the top of the sketch;\\nthat is, anyone who doesn?t seem to have joined the company after other employees. If we scan the\\nrules, we see that H in Rule 1 and K in Rule 2 both fit that description. Let?s therefore start by\\nputting an ?H? and a ?K? at the top of the sketch.\\nH joined before N. From the H at the top of the sketch, add a line down to an N.\\nK joined the company before J. Next to the H at the top of the sketch, we already have a K. From'),\n",

Fortunately, all of the entities are\\nincluded in the sketch, so we can depend solely on our master sketch to answer every question\\nwe?ll face. \\nBefore moving on, take a moment and review the sketch.

H and K are the only entities that aren?t below an entity, so\\neither H or K must have joined in 01. I, O, and M are the only employees with no entities below\\nthem, so they?re the only ones who could have joined in 08. While these aren?t earth-shattering\\ndeductions, it?s a good idea to take a moment and review what the completed sketch can tell you.\\nThis sets up the set?s parameters in your mind. \\nIt?s also wise to take a moment and recognize what the sketch can?t tell us.

The\\naction doesn?t become fully apparent until Rule 1 which introduces the concept of the ?color? of\\neach set of tickets. Some students were thrown by the notion of ?sets? of tickets in the opening\\nparagraph. They were worried that this implied a whole lot of tickets. If we read carefully, though, we\\nknow that that?s not a problem. There is one ?set? of tickets per month, as simple as that.\\nThe Key Issues are:\\n1) What color is each of the six sets of tickets?'),\n",

In Set 2, we talked about\\nidentifying the variable and fixed aspects when using a grid. What are the variable and fixed points\\nin this set? The two months, January and February, are fixed. They don?t change. The three railway\\nlines are also fixed, not going anywhere. What can change from line to line and month to month is\\nthe color of the sets of tickets. This is the variable aspect. So when creating our grid, the two fixed\\npoints (months and lines) will go along the top and side, and we will fill in the grid squares with the\\nvariable (color):\\nThe Rules:\\n1) gives the information that we?ve already included in the sketch above, namely that each set of\\ntickets will be green, purple, red, or yellow.\\n2) Let?s take our time and make sure that we fully understand this rule. The January set of tickets of\\neach line (1, 2, and 3) will be a different color from the February set of tickets of that line. Let?s do a\\n?what if? to make sure we have a handle on this rule. If the Jan 1 (January line 1) set of tickets is\\nred, then the Feb 1 (February line 1) set of tickets cannot be red. Draw a big ?X? between each\\nline?s January and February squares in our grid.\\n3) Again, we need to take our time when decoding this rule. Within each month, the set of tickets of'),\n",

Let?s do another\\n?what if.? If the Jan 1 (January line 1) set of tickets is red, then the Jan 2 (January line 2) set of\\ntickets can?t be red. Between each month?s 1 and 2 squares draw a big ?X,? and between each\\nmonth?s 2 and 3 squares draw a big ?X.?\\n4) Of the three sets of January tickets, exactly one must be red. Build this directly into our grid. Write\\n?ex. 1 R? at the bottom of the January column.\\n5) Once more, take care when translating Rule 5. This rule is quite similar to Rule 4. In Rule 4,\\nexactly one of the sets of January tickets (either line 1, 2, or 3) was red. Here, exactly one of the\\nsets of line 3 tickets (either January or February) must be green. At the end of the line 3 row, write\\n?ex. 1 G.?\\n6) Here is a nice, concrete piece of information. The Jan 2 set of tickets is purple. Build this right into\\nthe master sketch.\\n7) Finally, Rule 7 states that none of the sets of February tickets are purple. Write ?NO P? in each of\\nthe February squares in our grid.\\nKey Deductions:\\nRule 6 said that Jan 2 is purple. Rule 3 said that within each month, the sets of tickets for the three\\nlines must be of different colors. So we can deduce that Jan 1 and Jan 3 can?t be purple. Rule 7\\nalready said that NO sets of February tickets are purple, so we definitely know that Jan 2 is the only\\nset of tickets that is purple.\\nWe can deduce something else from Rule 7 which says that none of the February tickets are purple.'),\n",
