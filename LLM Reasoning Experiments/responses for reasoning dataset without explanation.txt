Question description: Eight persons namely P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, and W are sitting around a circular table facing the centre of the table but not necessarily in the same order. P sits second to the right of U, who sits opposite to T. Two persons sit between Q and T. S sits third to the right of P. V sits second to the left of W.
Question: How many persons sit between W and R when counted from the right of R?
Options: ["Two", "Three", "Four", "One", "None of these"]

Answer: To solve this problem, let's break down the given information:

1. P sits second to the right of U.
2. U sits opposite T (i.e., they are facing each other).
3. Two persons sit between Q and T.
4. S sits third to the right of P.
5. V sits second to the left of W.

From statement 2, we know that U and T sit opposite each other. So, when counting from the right of R (i.e., moving clockwise), let's place T at the top-right position in our imaginary circular table.

Now, based on the given statements:

- P sits second to the right of U, which means P sits between U and T.
- Two persons sit between Q and T, so they can't be together on either side of T. This implies that R must sit between two of them (either QR or TR), because there are no other positions left for such pairs. Therefore, we can determine the order as follows: UR...QRTVW.
- S sits third to the right of P, which means S is not sitting at W's position, since if it were, then V would be sitting on the left side of R and there wouldn't be any space for Q or T between R and two other persons. Therefore, the correct order should have P on one end (let's assume from the top, since that is where U sits opposite to T), followed by UR...QRTSVW.
- V sits second to the left of W.

Counting from the right of R:

Let's place the 8 persons around a table in this manner: P(U)...T(R)QSVW (imagine an empty space between 'P' and 'U', 'U' and 'T', etc. for proper seating arrangement). 

In the order above, if we count from R (at T), there are two persons sitting between W and R when counted from the right of R.

Therefore, the correct answer is: "Two".

Question description: Eight persons namely P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, and W are sitting around a circular table facing the centre of the table but not necessarily in the same order. P sits second to the right of U, who sits opposite to T. Two persons sit between Q and T. S sits third to the right of P. V sits second to the left of W.
Question: If all the persons sit alphabetically starting from P in clockwise direction, then how many will remain unchanged (except for P)?
Options: ["None", "One", "Two", "Three", "None of these"]
Answer: Let's analyze the given information:

1. P sits second to the right of U, who sits opposite to T.
2. Two persons sit between Q and T.
3. S sits third to the right of P.
4. V sits second to the left of W.

We are asked to find out how many persons will remain unchanged if all the persons sit alphabetically starting from P in a clockwise direction, except for P itself.

First, let's determine the relative positions of the persons:

- U is opposite T, so they cannot be adjacent (i.e., one to the left or right of the other). Let's place them as far apart as possible while maintaining their opposition. Suppose U sits at position 1 and T sits at position 7.
- Since P sits second to the right of U, P will sit at position 2.

Next, let's consider S. Given that S is third to the right of P, we can place S between positions 4 and 5 (i.e., one spot after Q and two spots before W). Now, since there are two persons sitting between Q and T, this means Q must sit at position 3 or 6.

Given these conditions, let's analyze all possible arrangements:

- If Q sits at position 3, then V will be at position 1 (second to the left of W), but U is already placed at position 1. So, Q cannot sit at position 3.
- Therefore, Q must sit at position 6.

Now we can fill in the rest of the table:

- P sits second to the right of U (at position 2).
- Q sits two spots away from T, so Q is at position 6 and T is opposite it (position 7), but this conflicts with our initial placement of U and T. Thus, we need to re-examine the relative positions of the persons:
  - If S sits third to the right of P, then S will be between positions 4 and 5.
  - Since two spots sit between Q and T, Q must be at position 6 and W must be at position 5 (because V sits second to the left of W).
  - Given these conditions, let's place U at position 1 (opposite T) and T at position 7.

We now have a complete arrangement:

P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W

This completes our initial assessment. We can now answer the question:

If all persons sit alphabetically starting from P in clockwise direction, then how many will remain unchanged (except for P)?

Based on our analysis, we found that there are no remaining spots left to place anyone else in the same order as given, since Q is at position 6 and U and T have been fixed. Therefore, no one but P can be placed in the same position.

So, the answer should be:

"None"

Question description: Eight persons namely P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, and W are sitting around a circular table facing the centre of the table but not necessarily in the same order. P sits second to the right of U, who sits opposite to T. Two persons sit between Q and T. S sits third to the right of P. V sits second to the left of W.
Question: How many persons sit between P and R, when counted from left of P?
Options: ["None", "One", "Two", "Three", "None of these"]
Answer: Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. P sits second to the right of U, who sits opposite to T.
2. Two persons sit between Q and T.
3. S sits third to the right of P.
4. V sits second to the left of W.

From statement 1, we can conclude that:
- U is not adjacent to P (since one person sits between them).
- The arrangement around the table must be such that P and U are separated by at least two seats in a clockwise direction from their relative positions to each other.

Now, let's consider the seating position of S and P:
- Since S sits third to the right of P, there must be at least 2 persons between them (including P).

From statement 4, we know that V sits second to the left of W. However, it doesn't provide any information about their positions in relation to P or R.

Now, let's try to deduce the possible position of Q and T:
- Since two persons sit between Q and T, we can assume they are seated opposite each other (as U is seated opposite to T).

Combining this with statement 1, where U sits opposite to T, it becomes evident that the seating arrangement around the table will have one person sitting between P and R.

From the given options, let's select "One" as our final answer.

Question description: Eight persons namely P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, and W are sitting around a circular table facing the centre of the table but not necessarily in the same order. P sits second to the right of U, who sits opposite to T. Two persons sit between Q and T. S sits third to the right of P. V sits second to the left of W.
Question: Who sits third to the left of V?
Options: ["U", "W", "Q", "R", "None of these"]

Answer: Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. P sits second to the right of U, who sits opposite to T.
2. Two persons sit between Q and T.
3. S sits third to the right of P.
4. V sits second to the left of W.

From statement (4), we know that V is sitting next to W on the left.

Now, let's consider the options given for the question "Who sits third to the left of V?":

* U
* W
* Q
* R
* None of these

Since V is sitting second to the left of W (statement 4), we can conclude that there must be one person between V and W on the right side. This person could only be P, as it is not mentioned anywhere else.

Now, looking at the given statements again:

1. P sits second to the right of U, who sits opposite to T.
2. Two persons sit between Q and T.

This implies that T and U are sitting opposite each other, with two people between them (Q). 

Considering this arrangement, we can see that R is not possible as it would require three people to be placed in a circular manner (T, U, and the person between Q and T), making no room for P.

The only arrangement possible is: 

V - P - U - W

Since there's no one else mentioned who sits two places before V on the left side.

Question description: Eight persons namely P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, and W are sitting around a circular table facing the centre of the table but not necessarily in the same order. P sits second to the right of U, who sits opposite to T. Two persons sit between Q and T. S sits third to the right of P. V sits second to the left of W.
Question: Who sits opposite to S?
Options: ["U", "V", "P", "Q", "None of these"]

Answer: Let's analyze the given information:

1. P sits second to the right of U, who sits opposite to T.
2. Two persons sit between Q and T.
3. S sits third to the right of P.
4. V sits second to the left of W.

From statement 1, we know that U is sitting opposite to T, which means that U and T are on either side of each other around the circular table.

Now, let's look at statement 2: "Two persons sit between Q and T." This implies that there are two people between Q and T in terms of their position around the table. However, it doesn't directly tell us who sits opposite to S.

However, since P is second to the right of U (statement 1), and S is third to the right of P (statement 3), we can infer that S must be sitting somewhere between U and T in terms of their positions around the table. 

Given this arrangement, it's clear that T sits opposite to U from statement 1.

So, we need to find out who sits opposite to S given its position relative to P. We already know S is third to the right of P.

Now let's think about possible seating arrangements where these conditions are satisfied:

If we assume U is sitting in position #8 (opposite T), then:
- The order for the people sitting around the table, starting from 1 and going clockwise, would be: ..., 7, 6, 5, P, S, Q, T, U

Now, if we want to find who sits opposite S, given that S is third to the right of P:
- Since there are eight people in total (a round table), S must sit on position #4.

If we look at this seating arrangement, it's clear that V and W cannot sit opposite S because they're too far away from each other. The same applies for Q and T since two persons have to sit between them according to statement 2.

So, the only option left is U and T. However, given that P sits second to the right of U (statement 1), it's impossible for V or W to be in position #4.

The most likely candidate would be someone not mentioned yet: U cannot occupy position #5; otherwise, P won't be able to sit two seats away from him. 

If we take into account statement 3 again - "Two persons sit between Q and T" - then it's clear that if V sits second to the left of W (statement 4), there is no room for them in the original order unless U, P, S, Q, or T were removed.

Now, thinking back on what was mentioned before: The seating arrangement is as follows:
..., 7, 6, 5, P, S, Q, T, U

If we take V and W into account (the fourth and fifth options) in a separate case where the table has only eight people:
- ..., 7, V, W, 4, 3, 2, 1

This leads us to conclude that there is no more room for P if S sits third to the right of him, as U occupies position #8.

Since this would break condition (c) - "S sits third to the right of P" - we can assume V and W are not occupying positions #4 or #5 either. 

The above argument implies that T must be sitting opposite S for the seating arrangement to satisfy all given conditions because it's impossible for U, V, or W to occupy position #5.

So, who sits opposite to S?

From statement 1, we know that T and U sit on either side of each other. If T is in the fifth spot, which makes him sitting across from P, and if two people are between Q and T (statement 2), then only T fits this description as S can't occupy position #4.

Thus, it's possible for V to be second to the left of W (as both appear together on opposite sides in a different seating arrangement).

However, there is one remaining option that has not been eliminated yet - U and T. We already ruled out everyone else.

So our final answer must be...

Question description: A law firm has exactly nine partners: Fox, Glassen, Hae, Inman, Jacoby, Kohn, Lopez, Malloy, and Nassar. Kohn's salary is greater than both Inman's and Lopez's. Lopez's salary is greater than Nassar's. Inman's salary is greater than Fox's. Fox's salary is greater than Malloy's. Malloy's salary is greater than Glassen's. Glassen's salary is greater than Jacoby's. Jacoby's salary is greater than Hae's.
Question: Which one of the following partners cannot have the third highest salary?
Options: [ "Fox", "Inman", "Lopez", "Malloy", "Nassar" ]
Answer: To determine which partner cannot have the third-highest salary, we must analyze the given conditions:

1. Kohn's salary is greater than both Inman's and Lopez's.
2. Lopez's salary is greater than Nassar's.
3. Inman's salary is greater than Fox's.
4. Fox's salary is greater than Malloy's.
5. Malloy's salary is greater than Glassen's.
6. Glassen's salary is greater than Jacoby's.
7. Jacoby's salary is greater than Hae's.

From condition 1, we know Kohn has a higher salary than both Inman and Lopez. This means that Inman and Lopez cannot have the highest salaries (which are reserved for those with salaries above others), but they can potentially be in the middle if there is another partner above them or below them. Similarly, condition 2 implies Nassar is not among the top three.

Condition 3 establishes a hierarchy where Inman has a higher salary than Fox and thus cannot have the third-highest salary because that would imply a direct relationship with both Kohn and Lopez (neither of which are possible due to conditions 1 and 2).

Similarly, condition 4 sets Fox above Malloy. Since Fox's position relative to other partners is defined but does not establish him as in a middle tier without further context about the salaries of others, we focus on where Inman stands.

Conditions 5 through 7 do provide additional orderings among the remaining partners, but they are more specific and do not directly impact our determination of which partner cannot have the third-highest salary. They essentially describe a broader hierarchy within the group that is already addressed by conditions 1 through 4 in terms of who can be above or below others.

Therefore, based on these conditions, we determine that:

The final answer is: Inman

Question description: A law firm has exactly nine partners: Fox, Glassen, Hae, Inman, Jacoby, Kohn, Lopez, Malloy, and Nassar. Kohn's salary is greater than both Inman's and Lopez's. Lopez's salary is greater than Nassar's. Inman's salary is greater than Fox's. Fox's salary is greater than Malloy's. Malloy's salary is greater than Glassen's. Glassen's salary is greater than Jacoby's. Jacoby's salary is greater than Hae's.
Question: If Malloy and Nassar earn the same salary, at least how many of the partners must have lower salaries than Lopez?
Options: [ "3", "4", "5", "6", "7" ]
Answer: Since Malloy's salary is greater than Glassen's and Glassen's salary is greater than Jacoby's, at least one of these two must have a lower salary than Lopez. Similarly, Hae has a lower salary than Jacoby and Jacoby has a lower salary than Lopez. So at least three must earn lower salaries than Lopez: Nassar (if his salary equals Malloy), Hae, and one of Glassen or Jacoby.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$
