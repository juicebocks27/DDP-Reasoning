Since U sits opposite to T, we can infer that Q must be sitting next to one of the two people who are sitting between Q and T.\\n3. S sits third to the right of P. This means that the order is: ..., P, ..., S, ...\\n4. V sits second to the left of W.\\n\\nNow, let's combine the information:\\n\\nSince U sits opposite to T, we know that the order must be: U, Q, R, S, P, V, W, T (or one of its rotations).\\n\\nFrom this, we can deduce the following:\\n\\n* W is sitting fourth from the left.\\n* R is sitting third from the left.\\n\\nWhen counted from the right of R, there are two people between W and R: Q and U.\",\n",
