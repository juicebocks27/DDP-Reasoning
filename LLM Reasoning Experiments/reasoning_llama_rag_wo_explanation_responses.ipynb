      "\n",
      "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\n",
      "When tossing three coins, each coin can result in either heads or tails. Therefore, for three coins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Identify the favorable outcomes\n",
      "We need to find the combinations where exactly two out of the three coins show heads. This can be achieved by choosing any two of the three coins to show heads and the remaining one to show tails. The combinations are HHT, HTH, and THH (where H represents heads and T represents tails).\n",

      "## Step 3: Calculate the probability\n",
      "The number of favorable outcomes is 3 (from step 2). The total number of possible outcomes is 8 (from step 1). Therefore, the probability of getting exactly two heads when tossing three coins is 3/8.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Step 1: Understand the Problem\n",
      "The problem is asking for the probability of getting tails twice in a row in two coin tosses. This can be solved using basic probability principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Calculate the Probability\n",
      "When tossing a fair coin, there's a 50% chance (or 1/2) of getting heads or tails on any given toss. Since we're interested in the outcome of two consecutive tosses and are specifically looking for tails twice in a row, we calculate this as follows: The probability of getting tails on the first toss is 1/2, and the same probability applies to getting tails again on the second toss.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3: Apply the Probability Rules\n",
      "To find the combined probability of two independent events happening (in this case, both tosses resulting in tails), we multiply the probabilities of each event. So, for two consecutive coin tosses where we want both outcomes to be tails, the calculation is (1/2) * (1/2).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Calculate the Final Probability\n",
      "Multiplying these probabilities gives us 1/4 or 0.25.\n",

      "\n",
      "We know that half of the cards in a standard deck are red (hearts or diamonds) and the other half are black (clubs or spades).\n",
      "\n",
      "When we draw the first card, it can be either red or black with equal probability. If it is red, there are 26 remaining red cards out of 51 total cards, so the probability that the second card is also red is 26/51.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, if the first card is black, there are 26 remaining black cards out of 51 total cards, and the probability that the second card is also black is 26/51.\n",

      "\n",
      "The total number of balls in the bag is 5 (red) + 4 (blue) + 3 (green) = 12.\n",
      "\n",
      "To find the probability that both balls drawn are red, we need to consider the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw: 5/12\n",
      "2. Since the ball is not replaced, the probability of drawing a second red ball after the first one: 4/11\n",
      "\n",
      "The combined probability of both events occurring (both balls being red) is the product of these two probabilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "(5/12) × (4/11) = 20 / 132\n",

This can be solved using basic probability principles.\\n\\n## Step 2: Calculate the Probability\\nWhen tossing a fair coin, there's a 50% chance (or 1/2) of getting heads or tails on any given toss. Since we're interested in the outcome of two consecutive tosses and are specifically looking for tails twice in a row, we calculate this as follows: The probability of getting tails on the first toss is 1/2, and the same probability applies to getting tails again on the second toss.\\n\\n## Step 3: Apply the Probability Rules\\nTo find the combined probability of two independent events happening (in this case, both tosses resulting in tails), we multiply the probabilities of each event. So, for two consecutive coin tosses where we want both outcomes to be tails, the calculation is (1/2) * (1/2).\\n\\n## Step 4: Calculate the Final Probability\\nMultiplying these probabilities gives us 1/4 or 0.25.\\n\\nThe final answer is: $\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{1}{4}}$\", 'correct_answer': '\"1/4\"', 'label': '', 'type': 'coin toss'}, {'description': '', 'question': 'If you flip a fair coin four times, what is the probability of getting at least one tail?', 'options': '', 'retrieved_context': 'Question 37:\\nQuestion: In a game with three eight-sided dice, what is the probability of getting at least one even\\nnumber?\\nAnswer: \"7/8\"\\nQuestion 38:\\nQuestion: If you roll a fair six-sided die four times, what is the probability of getting at most one 2?\\nAnswer: \"125/144\"\\nQuestion 39:\\nQuestion: If you roll three six-sided dice, what is the probability of getting at most two 4s?\\nAnswer: \"215/216\"\\nQuestion 40:\\nContext: Answer the following questions for a standard deck of 52 cards.\\nyellow.

So, for four rolls, the probability is \\\\((\\\\frac{5}{6})^4\\\\).\\n- **Probability of exactly one 2:** There are several ways to get exactly one 2 in four rolls: the 2 can appear in any of the four positions. The probability of getting a specific sequence (like 2,3,3,3) is \\\\((\\\\frac{1}{6})(\\\\frac{5}{6})^3\\\\). There are 4 positions for the 2 to be in, so we multiply this by 4: \\\\(4(\\\\frac{1}{6})(\\\\frac{5}{6})^3\\\\).\\n\\nThe total probability of getting at most one 2 is therefore:\\n\\\\[P = \\\\left( \\\\frac{5}{6} \\\\right)^4 + 4 \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{6} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{5}{6} \\\\right)^3\\\\]\\n\\nCalculating this gives us the probability.\\n\\n**Question 39**\\nIf you roll three six-sided dice, what is the probability of getting at most two 4s?\\n\\nThis involves breaking down into cases based on how many 4s are rolled:\\n1. **Getting no 4s:** The probability that a die shows not a 4 is \\\\(\\\\frac{5}{6}\\\\), so for three dice, it's \\\\((\\\\frac{5}{6})^3\\\\).\\n2. **Getting exactly one 4:** We need to consider the number of positions (3) where the 4 can appear and multiply by that.\\n3. **Getting exactly two 4s:** There are combinations of dice rolls where exactly two out of three dice show a 4.\\n\\nThe probability calculation involves calculating each case, summing them up, and simplifying the expression to get a final probability in its simplest form.\\n\\n**Question 40**\\nContext: Answer the following questions for a standard deck of 52 cards.\\nWhich one of the following statements could be true?\\n\\nThis question seems incomplete. However, given the context about different colors (red, green, purple) and lines (1, 2, 3), we can infer that it's asking which statement concerning the distribution of ticket colors by line could be true.\\n\\nLet's focus on Question 41 for now.\\n**Question 41**\\nContext: Answer the following questions for a standard dice with numbers from 1 to 6 (unless mentioned otherwise) answer the following questions.\\n\\nWhat is the probability that a card drawn at random from a well-shuffled pack of 52 cards is red color or king?\\n\\nThere are 26 red cards and 2 kings in the deck, making a total of 28 cards we're interested in. The probability of drawing one of these is \\\\(\\\\frac{28}{52}\\\\).\\n\\n**Question 42**\\nIf two cards are drawn from a well-shuffled pack of 52 cards, the probability that they are of the same color?\\n\\nThere are 26 red cards and 26 black cards (since we only consider suits as colors for this problem). The total number of ways to draw any two cards is \\\\(\\\\binom{52}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nThe probability that both cards drawn are of the same color can be broken down into cases for each color.\\n\\n**Question 43**\\nWhat is the probability of rolling a sum of 6 when rolling two six-sided dice?\\n\\nTo find the probability of rolling a specific sum, we need to consider all combinations that give us this sum. For a sum of 6, these are (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), and (5,1).\\n\\nThere are 36 possible outcomes when two dice are rolled since each die has 6 faces, giving \\\\(6 \\\\times 6 = 36\\\\) total combinations. The probability of rolling a sum of 6 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\\n\\nCalculating this gives us the final answer.\", 'correct_answer': '\"5/36\"', 'label': '', 'type': 'dice problems'}, {'description': '', 'question': 'A bag contains 5 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 3 green balls.
