            "4. **`get_neighbors()` and `get_between()`:** These functions demonstrate how to query the arrangement for specific information.\n",

            "* **Handling More Complex Scenarios:** The code can be extended to handle more representatives, more complex conditions, or conditions involving distances greater than one seat.\n",
            "* **Better User Input:**  Instead of hardcoding the representatives, allow the user to input them.\n",
            "* **More Robust Error Handling:** Add checks to handle invalid inputs (e.g., duplicate representatives).\n",
            "* **Visualization:** Create a visual representation of the seating arrangements (e.g., using a library like `matplotlib`).\n",
            "* **Algorithmic Efficiency:** For significantly larger problems, consider more efficient algorithms than brute-force permutation generation.  Constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solvers might be more appropriate.\n",
